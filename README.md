# blink

PowerShell script for known-safe screenshotter.

Currently refining; strongly suggest minimizing window after start. I'll figure it out later.

Need to add command line flags, fractional time handling, improve interval handling. Throws non-fatal error if screen is sleeping unless run as admin.

Important thing: it works and has saved me a few times.

(Ignore .bat file, it's in progress.)
